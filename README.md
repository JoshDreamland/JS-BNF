This is a BNF-grammar-taking parser.

Backstory: I have to write a recursive-descent parser for a class I'm taking. Too lazy for that. Would rather write something to just parse the grammar for me. Ergo, this project was born.

Too scared to add in error checking without version control. So that's how it got here.
