/**
 * @file  bnfparser.js
 * @brief If BNF can describe it, this can parse it.
 * 
 * This is a general-purpose BNF parser. Given a BNF grammar file,
 * it will produce a set of rules. Given a set of rules, it will
 * read a string into a syntax tree.
 * 
 * For maximum efficiency, rule options should be listed with as great
 * a common prefix as possible. For example, consider this rule:
 * 
 *   <rule1> ::= <rule2> + <rule2> | <rule2> * <rule2> | <rule2>
 * 
 * In the event that rule2 is read, and a + is not encountered, the
 * grammar can instead use the second option. If no * is encountered,
 * only then will the parser terminate, thus eliminating backtracking.
 * 
 * Specifying the rules in other orders will still work, but could take
 * ages for long strings. Respect the NP-completeness of what you are
 * asking this program to do.
 * 
 * If you don't feel like doing this, call bnf.optimize_rules() on
 * your rule set to have the system alphabetize them for you. The
 * effect should be the same.
 * 
 * @section PURPOSE
 * 
 * I've written so many parsers, I'm sick of them. So when the CSE 655
 * assignment called for another parser, I decided to just write an
 * end-all version. It was less dreadfully boring, and in some regards,
 * easier than translating the rules myself.

 * As an example, this string:
 * 
 *   <B> | <B> plus <A>
 * 
 * Becomes this object:
 * 
 *   [ [ "<B>" ], [ "<B>", " ", "plus", " ", "<A>" ] ]
